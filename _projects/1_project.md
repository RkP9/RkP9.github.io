### The Challenge: Healing a Broken Bone

When a bone is severely damaged, it can't always heal on its own. **Bone tissue engineering** offers a solution: creating a supportive structure, or **scaffold**, where new bone cells can grow and regenerate the damaged tissue. Think of it like the scaffolding on a building‚Äîit provides the framework for new construction.

The big question is: **what's the best material to build this scaffold from?** It needs to be strong, biocompatible (so the body doesn't reject it), and actively encourage cells to thrive. For this project, I decided to put three promising candidates to the test.

### The Contenders: A Head-to-Head Comparison

I created and compared three different types of scaffolds, each with a unique approach to solving the problem.

1.  **The Workhorse (Silk Scaffold):** Silk is an amazing natural material. It's incredibly strong and biocompatible. I processed *Bombyx mori* silk cocoons to create a pure, porous scaffold. But on its own, it's just a physical structure.

2.  **The Upgrade (SBF-Coated Silk):** Could I make the silk scaffold even better? I coated it with **Simulated Body Fluid (SBF)**, a solution with an ion concentration that mimics human blood plasma. The idea was to create a "bioactive" surface that would trick bone cells into thinking they were in a more natural environment.

3.  **The Gold Standard (Bone Scaffold):** To have a benchmark, I took real porcine femur bone and used a chemical process called **decellularization** to gently remove all the original cells, leaving behind the pure, natural bone matrix. This represents the ideal environment that we are trying to replicate.

### How They Were Made: The Science Behind the Scaffolds

Here's a closer look at the scientific process used to create each type of scaffold. üî¨

* **Silk Scaffolds (Lyophilization):**
    The process began with *Bombyx mori* cocoons, which were boiled in a 0.012 M sodium carbonate (Na‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ) solution to remove the glue-like sericin protein, isolating the pure silk fibroin. This fibroin was then dissolved in a 9.3 M lithium bromide (LiBr) solution at 60¬∞C and dialyzed for 48 hours to remove the salt, resulting in a pure, aqueous silk solution. This solution was then frozen at -80¬∞C and placed under a vacuum in a process called **lyophilization** (freeze-drying). This technique removes the ice by sublimation, leaving behind a highly porous, sponge-like scaffold ideal for cells to infiltrate.

* **SBF-Coated Silk Scaffolds (Biomimetic Mineralization):**
    To "supercharge" the silk, I first sterilized the finished scaffolds with ethanol and UV light. Then, I submerged them in **Simulated Body Fluid (SBF)**, which was prepared with ion concentrations (Ca¬≤‚Å∫, PO‚ÇÑ¬≥‚Åª, etc.) nearly identical to human blood plasma. The scaffolds were incubated in this solution for 7 days at 37¬∞C. This process encourages a bone-like hydroxyapatite mineral layer to form on the silk surface, enhancing its bioactivity.

* **Bone Scaffolds (Decellularization):**
    The goal here was to preserve the natural architecture of bone while removing all original cellular material to prevent an immune reaction. Fresh porcine femur bone was sliced into discs. These discs were then subjected to a rigorous chemical treatment, first with a 1% SDS (a powerful detergent) solution for 48 hours, followed by another 48 hours in Triton X-100 to break down and wash away all cell membranes and genetic material. The resulting structure is an **acellular bone scaffold**‚Äîthe pure, natural mineral and protein matrix of the bone, ready to be repopulated by new cells.

### The Verdict: How Did They Perform?

I seeded all three scaffold types with human osteoblast-like cells (MG-63) and measured their growth over five days. To see how many cells were alive and thriving, I used an **MTT assay**, which measures the metabolic activity of the cells‚Äîessentially, the more "purple" the result, the more happy, active cells there are.

The results were clear and exciting.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

As expected, the **natural bone scaffold performed the best**. The cells felt right at home.

However, the most important finding was that the **SBF-coated silk dramatically outperformed the plain silk scaffold**. This simple surface modification made a huge difference, creating a much more welcoming environment for the bone cells. It proved that we can take a simple, versatile material like silk and intelligently upgrade it to be a much more effective tool for regeneration.

### Why It Matters

This project underscores a key principle in tissue engineering: **it's not just about the material, but about the microenvironment it creates.** By mimicking the body's natural chemistry with an SBF coating, we can significantly boost the performance of synthetic scaffolds. This research opens the door for developing smarter, more bioactive materials that could one day help accelerate healing in patients with severe bone injuries.

### Presentation

Here is the slide deck that I presented for this project (and successfully defended my thesis!).

<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
